    <p>
        On the market today, there exists a subset of a common computer peripheral meant to boost a basic end-user's
        productivity. This product is the programmable mouse. The concept is simple; it is a computer mouse that contains
        several extra buttons that the user can map to any shortcut or command which he/she chooses. The added convenience
        of these extra buttons means that a user can save valuable time when performing common, repetitive tasks. Currently,
        this type of device only exists for the mouse, but not for the trackpad which has millions of users every day. This
        is where our project comes in. Our purpose in creating the Programmable Trackpad is to bring this type of technology
        to the trackpad, for users who prefer to use a trackpad over a mouse. Our trackpad will contain a suite of macro
        keys and rotary encoders, all of which end users can program themselves. With these, trackpad users will be granted
        the same convenience and functionality as programmable mouse users in a compact and ergonomic package. This device
        is intended to completely replace the default trackpad on a traditional laptop.
