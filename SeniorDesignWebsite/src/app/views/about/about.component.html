    <p>
        On the market today, there exists a subset of a
        common computer peripheral meant to boost a basic
        end-user's productivity. This product is the
        programmable mouse. The concept is simple; it is a
        computer mouse that contains several extra buttons that
        the user can map to any shortcut or command which
        he/she chooses. The added convenience of these extra
        buttons means that a user can save valuable time when
        performing common, repetitive tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, this type of device only exists for the
        mouse, but not for the trackpad which has millions of
        users every day. This is where our project comes in. Our
        purpose in creating the Programmable Trackpad is to
        bring this type of technology to the trackpad, for users
        who prefer to use a trackpad over a mouse. Our
        trackpad will contain a suite of macro keys and rotary
        encoders, all of which end users can program
        themselves. With these, trackpad users will be granted
        the same convenience and functionality as
        programmable mouse users in a compact and ergonomic
        package. This device is intended to completely replace
        the default trackpad on a traditional laptop.

        The guiding principle of our development process is
        this: create a system which, when connected to a PC,
        can act as a trackpad and a macro keypad. In order to
        accomplish this, we will create a hardware device with
        input systems (trackpad and keypad) and a software
        application which the PC will use to interpret the
        hardware's output. Additionally, the device's firmware
        will manage communication between the device and the
        PC.
